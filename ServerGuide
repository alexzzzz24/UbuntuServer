                                     UBUNTU SERVER INSTALLTION
Ubuntu Server is a variant of the Ubuntu operating system designed specifically for server use. 
Unlike the standard Ubuntu Desktop edition, it does not come with a graphical interface by default, 
which helps reduce system resource usage and makes it ideal for running services and applications in the background. 
Ubuntu Server is highly versatile and commonly used for cloud computing, hosting, databases, web servers, and more.

Download th Ubuntu Server ISO
https://ubuntu.com/download/server

Flash the ISO to a USB Stick using Balena Etcher or a disk imaging program of your choice:
https://etcher.balena.io/

Install the Server!
Select the default setting except you uncheck “Set up this drive as an LVM group” when asked about partitioning your drive" 
because you want to use all the avaiable disk space

Assigning a static IP address to your server
Recommended Method: Go to your Gateway and mannual reserve a static IP address to your server’s network configuration.

SSH Setup
Select [*] Install OpenSSH server, leave everything else default

SERVER INSTALLED AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO SSH USING THE CREDENTIAL YOU CREATED EARLIER
E.G: SSH USERNAME@10.0.0.10
   : password

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     SAMBA SERVER INSTALLTION
Samba is a server software that enables file and printer sharing between different operating systems, 
primarily allowing Linux/Unix systems to share files and printers with Windows systems over a network. 
It implements the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which is the protocol Windows systems use for network file and printer sharing, 
making it possible for non-Windows systems to access and share files with Windows machines seamlessly

**SSH TO YOUR SERVER
SSH USERNAME@10.0.0.10

**INSTALL SAMBA
sudo apt install samba

**CREATE DIRECTORY FOR MAPPIONG PURPOSE LATER
sudo mkdir /media/myfiles

**Since this folder will likely be accessed by other utilities,
**it is best to give your user all permissions to avoid issues later on.
sudo chown $USER: /media/myfiles

**CONFIGURE ON YOUR SERVER, ONLY ALLOWING THE CORRECT CREDENTIAL TO LOG IN. BY DEFAULT, 
**SAMBA WILL TREAT ANY ATTEMPTS TO LOG IN WITH THE WRONG CREDENTIALS AS A GUEST USER.
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
map to guest = never            ****CHANGE FROM map to guest = bad user TO map to guest = never

** ADD THIS TO THE END OF THE FILE
[myfiles]                   **myfiles is your share name, and will be used when connecting over the network
  path = /media/myfiles     **path is the folder shared from your server
  writeable=yes             **allows the creation and editing of files
  public=no                 ** hides the share if the user isn’t authenticated

Once that’s done, save the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y and Enter

**SET THE LOG IN CREDENTIAL AND PASSWORD.YOU’LL USE ON CLIENT MACHINES TO CONNECT TO THE NETWORK STORAGE
sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME

sudo systemctl restart smb    **To restart Samba and make sure the changes go through

                                INSTALL JELLYFIN INSTALLATION
Jellyfin is a media management tool for Movies, Shows and Music.

** INSTALL ON SERVER
curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash
SERVER_ADDRESS:8096    **ACCESS VIA WEBSITE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Wireguard VPN INSTALLION
Wireguard is a free and open source VPN. 
You may use Wireguard to access the devices on your home network 
from outside of your home network without having to port forward all of your services. 
This greatly increases your network’s security, 
as less services are exposed and there are less entry points for your network.


                               1.INSTALL DYNAMIC DNS FISRT
Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that automatically updates the DNS records for a 
domain name whenever the IP address of the host changes. 
This is particularly useful for devices or services that do not have a static IP address, 
which can change frequently, such as those provided by many Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

** WE WILL BE USING DUCKDNS.ORG
https://www.duckdns.org/
1.CREATE A DOMAIN
2.install LOCATED AT TOP LEFT CORNER 
3.Operating Systems: linux cron
4.follow the linux cron guide

                              2.Port Forwarding
In order for Wireguard to work, you will need to forward port 51820 in your router’s web interface. 
This varies on each router, so you will have to find how to do it in your router specifically. 
Look for an Internet, Firewall, Security and Port Forwarding section. 
Make sure to select the IP of your server as the LAN IP Address, 51820 as the port on both WAN and LAN and use UDP as the protocol.

Do a google search based on your router carrier, E.G Xfinity

                             3.Install Wireguard
To install Wireguard, you can use the PiVPN scripts. 
Although they are designed to run on Raspberry Pi OS, 
they also work on Ubuntu Server, as they are both based on Debian. 

curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash

Don’t worry about the DHCP stuff in the installation, you’ve reserved your server’s local IP address in your router settings earlier. 
Leave the port as the default value, port 51820, which is the one we forwarded before. 
You can select any DNS provider you want, we’re going to scroll down to select CloudFlare. 
After this step is the important part - 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
make sure to select “DNS Entry” instead of the IP address that shows up. Here, we’re going to input the DuckDNS address we made earlier                +
We also recommend enabling unattended upgrades, for extra security.                                                                                    +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Setting up clients
pivpn add   ** give a name to our client. It can be anything you want
pivpn -qr   ** open the Wireguard app and scan the qr code

From this point on, you can turn on the toggle switch that connects to your home network, 
and route all your traffic through there. 
If you can see that both “Data Sent” and “Data Received” are going up, the connection works. 
This means you can use something like Swiftfin on your iPhone to enjoy your Jellyfin media from anywhere.
