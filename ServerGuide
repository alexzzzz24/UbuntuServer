                                     UBUNTU SERVER INSTALLTION
Ubuntu Server is a variant of the Ubuntu operating system designed specifically for server use. 
Unlike the standard Ubuntu Desktop edition, it does not come with a graphical interface by default, 
which helps reduce system resource usage and makes it ideal for running services and applications in the background. 
Ubuntu Server is highly versatile and commonly used for cloud computing, hosting, databases, web servers, and more.

                                     SAMBA SERVER INSTALLTION
Samba is a server software that enables file and printer sharing between different operating systems, 
primarily allowing Linux/Unix systems to share files and printers with Windows systems over a network. 
It implements the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which is the protocol Windows systems use for network file and printer sharing, 
making it possible for non-Windows systems to access and share files with Windows machines seamlessly

**SSH TO YOUR SERVER
SSH USERNAME@10.0.0.10

**INSTALL SAMBA
sudo apt install samba

**CREATE DIRECTORY FOR MAPPIONG PURPOSE LATER
sudo mkdir /media/myfiles

**Since this folder will likely be accessed by other utilities,
**it is best to give your user all permissions to avoid issues later on.
sudo chown $USER: /media/myfiles

**CONFIGURE ON YOUR SERVER, ONLY ALLOWING THE CORRECT CREDENTIAL TO LOG IN. BY DEFAULT, 
**SAMBA WILL TREAT ANY ATTEMPTS TO LOG IN WITH THE WRONG CREDENTIALS AS A GUEST USER.
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
map to guest = never            ****CHANGE FROM map to guest = bad user TO map to guest = never

** ADD THIS TO THE END OF THE FILE
[myfiles]                   **myfiles is your share name, and will be used when connecting over the network
  path = /media/myfiles     **path is the folder shared from your server
  writeable=yes             **allows the creation and editing of files
  public=no                 ** hides the share if the user isn’t authenticated

Once that’s done, save the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y and Enter

**SET THE LOG IN CREDENTIAL AND PASSWORD.YOU’LL USE ON CLIENT MACHINES TO CONNECT TO THE NETWORK STORAGE
sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME

sudo systemctl restart smbd    **To restart Samba and make sure the changes go through
