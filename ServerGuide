                                        SAMBA SERVER INSTALLTION
Samba is a server software that enables file and printer sharing between different operating systems, 
primarily allowing Linux/Unix systems to share files and printers with Windows systems over a network. 
It implements the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which is the protocol Windows systems use for network file and printer sharing, 
making it possible for non-Windows systems to access and share files with Windows machines seamlessly
